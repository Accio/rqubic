Version 1.1-4 (2015-04-09)
  + Makefile is updated to be portable between platforms
  + Dependency on Biobase, biclust, and methods is changed into 'Imports' to make the package respect other packages
  + A few trivial bugs are removed
  + Generic function 'conditions' is now imported from BioGenerics

Version 1.1-3 (2012-01-05)
  + Minor bug fix in readBiclusterResults: bicluster files without any bicluster are recognized
  + Minor bug fix in readBiclusterResults: bicluster files with only one bicluster and one row/column not report error anymore (previously due to matrix dropping)
  + Minor bug fix in readBiclusterResults: feature/condition names are written in "features"/"conditions" items in the info list
  + Feature improvement in readBiclusterResults: featureNames and sampleNames are written in Parameters, so as to be used by the coerce method in the eisa package, to coerce a Biclust object into an ISAModules object
  + Methods features and conditions now have a two-step strategy: first try the info list, if failed, then try the matrix names
  + length.Biclust returns 0 if the Biclust object contains no bicluster
  + combineBiclusts support non-empty Biclust objects with empty Biclust objects, e.g. those without valid biclusters detected.

Version 1.1-2 (2012-01-03)
  + Add fcFilter for feature-condition filtering

Version 1.1-1 (2011-12-22)
  + Generalize S4 methods for QUBICBiclusterSet to Biclust: most of the S4 methods now can be applied to a Biclust object.
  + Add the combineBiclusts method to combine multiple Biclust/QUBICBiclusterSet objects.
  + Add readBiclusterResults function to complement the writeBiclusterResults function in the biclust package.

Version 0.99.1 (2011-08-11)
  + Rename quantile.discritize to quantileDiscritize in order to avoid conflicts with the S3 method nomenclature

Version 0.99.0 (2011-08-05)
  + Re-starting version indexing due to submission to the Bioc repository

Version 1.8.1 (2011-08-02)
  + Fix errors in documentations

Version 1.8.0 (2011-07-11)
  + Submission to Bioconductor
